<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-682" title="pandaroute_stream-192x192_" src="http://pavingways.com/wp-content/uploads/pandaroute_stream-192x192_.jpg" alt="" width="192" height="192" />Our Panda Route Travel Planner widget has made it to Nokia’s Ovi Store. The basic idea behind the widget is that **you have all your important travel data with you while you are on the go** . It works pretty easy: before you start your journey, you enter all the details of your upcoming trip that you need to remember (e.g. airline, flight times, hotel address, rental car reservation number etc.). Then the widget shows you the current step of your journey with all the needed information depending on the current time. On your Nokia N97 home screen this information will be shown too. So you have access to this information without interaction with the application and even when not connected to the Internet.



We also integrated **a Twitter feed ** matching the location of your upcoming destination. It is a great source for any kind of information, such as events, news, things to watch out for or people nearby; and you know what is going on there before you arrive.



The widget is **free**  and **available for Nokia N97** . So, before you start your next trip, try it out and let us know what you think!

**PS:** 

You will find our widget in the Ovi store under “Nokia N97 devices” under “Applications” -&gt; “City Guides/Maps” or by searching for “panda”.
