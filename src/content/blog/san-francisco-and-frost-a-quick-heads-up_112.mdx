<div class="entry-content">
It has been a busy month and our last post was already a long while ago. So here’s a quick heads-up ...



Our Ajax library, Frost, is still in development, but we already received some good response and many requests for more info ranging from freelancers to people from well-known companies. There is a lot of interest out there and we try to get the initial library online within the next couple of weeks. There’s also a definite plan how users will be able to contribute by extending the library and by testing browsers. Let us know if you want to help either building the lib or the community pages around this (based on WordPress)!



For now we have a video on YouTube that shows how the demo page of the Frost library works and looks like on the iPhone  (we actually found a bug in Safari), so check it out!



Meanwhile we **moved to San Francisco** , at least for the next few months. Our goals are to get in touch with like-minded people from the Bay Area, build-up some interesting contacts and cooperations and introduce Frost and our upcoming mobile service to as many people as we can. So, if you are also in the Bay Area, please let us know!



There are a lot of events happening and we gonna write about it and let you know what’s happening.



We’re currently looking for a space in an office (for 2 people) - we talked to Chris from CitizenSpace in downtown SF and might end up working there, but if you have a better idea or even a little space in your office, please let us know!
