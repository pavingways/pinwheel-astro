On August, 18, we attended the **BarCampBlock** . Although it was almost two weeks ago, I still feel like I should post about it, because it was our first BarCamp and also its anniversary (block)party. The BarCampBlock took place in Palo Alto - at the place it started. We went by bus from San Francisco to Palo Alto and it took us almost 2 hours. But it was worth it. Almost 1,000 participants attended this year. Amazing!

We met so many interesting people and of course the guys from Citizen Space :) Thanks go out to Tara, Chris, Liz, Hillary and anybody I can’t think of now, who all did a great job by organizing such a great event. The center of this whole event was the office of Socialtext, where there were an impressively huge wall with different discussion sessions. You could either open a new session yourself or join an existing one. Socialtext already hosted the first BarCamp in 2005.



At 7 pm the actual BarCampBlock Party started with free drinks and food at the Blue Chalk Cafe right after the DemoCamp which featured many interesting demos from various companies. Among many interesting people we also met Tim there, who started the Webmontag (Webmonday) in Germany.



All in all: great event, great atmosphere, many interesting people, we’re looking forward to the next one!
