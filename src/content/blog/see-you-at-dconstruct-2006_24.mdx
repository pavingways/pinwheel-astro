d.Construct 2006 is a one-day web conference in Brighton, England, on the 8th of September. It is organized by the nice guys from Clearleft, namely Jeremy Keith, Andy Budd and Richard Rutter.



To quote from the website, d.Construct “... discusses how new technology is transforming the web from a document delivery system into an application platform.” So it seems we’re going to be at the right place - also for (mobile) web applications!



We are looking forward to seeing many people from the atmedia event this year and we hope to get in touch with many new people in the mobile area as well.
