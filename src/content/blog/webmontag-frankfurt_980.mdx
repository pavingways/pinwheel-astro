					Yesterday we went to the Webmontag in Frankfurt. It took off at 7 pm and was pretty well attended (&gt;100 people). First there were some
					presentations about Barcamps in general, Conceptual Designers, PR &amp; social media, Wikis for agencys and companies and why todolists fail. I really liked the twitter wall even though the filter only worked for the hashtag #Webmontag and not for #wmfra.
					


					

					1.5 hours later the networking part started. Nice people, nice talks. Here are some photos from yesterday @ flickr.com.
					


					

					The next Webmontag Frankfurt is scheduled for 04. December. One talk will be about Google Wave. Btw many thanks to Darren &amp; the rest of the orga team for organizing this! See you there!
