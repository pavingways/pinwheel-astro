<div class="entry-content">
This Monday we held the second iteration of our JavaScript User Group here in Frankfurt: #jsugfra (thanks Björn!)



There were only around 12 attendees there, although signups ranged around 20 - so shame on you if you didn’t show up! ;)



But it’s your loss, because aside from Evgenij’s talk you missed my “little” (1hr) hands-on session showing how you can deploy the same JS-based app - build upon Unify - to several platforms, namely those:<ul>	<li>the browser,</li>	<li>homescreen (appcache on iOS) - this is different from the browser,</li>	<li>iOS (iPhone and iPad with PhoneGap),</li>	<li>Android (PhoneGap too),</li>	<li>BlackBerry PlayBook (WebWorks on TabletOS),</li>	<li>Samsung Bada (JS-App-Package),</li>	<li>WAC (sort of),</li>	<li>and Samsung Internet@TV</li></ul>

Unify makes this easy in many regards (JS-build process, appcache context detection etc.). My goal was to show the difficulties and differences in SDKs and build/deployment tools - this became pretty clear I think, especially talking about the difficulties. The main message I wanted to bring across this evening was:

**If you want people to write apps for your platform, then given them some decent development tools!** 



This means preferably CLI build/deploy tools (helps with automating builds) and a well working Simulator/Emulator plus simple device deployments. If you consider these points and look at the app numbers in different stores you see what I mean:<ul>	<li>Apple got this one right (Xcode and iOS Simulator just work, simple device deployments),</li>	<li>Android is behind in this (Eclipse and especially the Emulator is unusably slow, device deployment easy),</li>	<li>Blackberry is not bad (CLI tools, fast Emulator, simple deployment to devices),</li>	<li>Samsung does a separate thing for different platforms and both are Eclipse-based (only Windows! WTF?, Emulators work well tho)</li>	<li>WAC uses the Android Emulator (cf. above) with a Widget Runtime on it and an Eclipse-based SDK (translation: slow)</li></ul>

Bottom line is: Many Edit-&gt;Build-&gt;Deployment chains are just so unbearably slow and/or unusable that it takes all the fun out of coding for these platforms. If you add the Appstore(tm)-submission overhead to the calculation, pure development work becomes a much smaller part in the total effort.

Sebastian also wrote in detail about the JSUG meeting itself - thanks for that!

Looking forward to jsugfra[2]
