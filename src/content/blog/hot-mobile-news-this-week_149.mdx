- Vodafone sued T-Mobile in Germany  over its exclusive contract with Apple. That’s why Vodafone had issued a “restraining order” against T-Mobile for offering the iPhone exclusively. Another German carrier Debitel had also complained to the German telecommunications regulators about the exclusive deal (which ties the iPhone to a single carrier).

T-Mobile announced yesterday that they will now **also**  sell the iPhone in Germany **without the 24-month contract**  as well as **without SIM lock** . T-Mobile’s unlocked iPhones (without a contract) will cost **999 EUR**  (1473 USD).

Customers who sign up for a 2-year T-Mobile contract get the device for 399 EUR (588 USD) plus (at least) 49.99 EUR/month.
