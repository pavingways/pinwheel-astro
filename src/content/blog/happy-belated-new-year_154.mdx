<div class="entry-content">
In the first post this year we wish all of you a happy and successful year 2008!



We have not blogged in a while. The good thing about this is that we were busy working on our first product, Groupile. Groupile will be a productive networking tool for groups. It is going to be ubiquitous, mobile-focused and web based. There will be a beta test soon, so make sure you sign up for that at groupile.com!



Another thing that weâ€™ve been working on was our Mobile Ajax Library, Frost. We booked a domain for the project and installed a very basic homepage. frostlib.org will from now on be the official home of the Frost library providing all the available information about the project. A pre-release version of the library is available for download there too.
