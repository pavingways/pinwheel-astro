To all Nokia device owners out there: open your Nokia device browser and go to store.ovi.com. Now you can personalize your Nokia phone by downloading apps, ringtones, widgets, games, videos etc.



The mobile client is available in English, German, Italian, Russian, and Spanish and supports operator billing in Australia, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Russia, Singapore, Spain and the United Kingdom. Globally, credit card billing is available through the mobile application and the mobile website. On the N97 the store application is pre-installed, same for all other new devices that are supported.

We did a quick test on our N78 and N97 (we have a prototype) and all seems to work great now. Apparently the store was down this morning for a few hours (German time), probably due to the high load after all the press releases were published.



In case you are looking for our Panda Route Travel Planner widget in the Ovi store - it will be available pretty soon, as it is in QA currently. We’ll let you know as soon as you can start downloading it - it’s even gonna be free for N97s!
