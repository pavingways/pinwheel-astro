<div class="entry-content">
Earlier this week we started working from the Citizen Space offices. It is more efficient than working at coffee shops. We met Tara and Chris from Citizen Space there and a couple of other interesting people/companies. Everybody is very friendly and we really like the idea of coworking. Instead of sitting alone in an office you can meet lots of new and also international people.



If you are in San Francisco and need a place to work, then you should definitely try Citizen Space located at 425 Second St on the third floor - make sure thereâ€™s a place available by calling them before.
