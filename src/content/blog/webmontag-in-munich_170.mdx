Yesterday we attended the Webmontag at Optaros in Munich. Nice people, interesting event, relaxed atmosphere and you always meet new people, but also see familiar faces ... like Claudia (CScout), Georg and Raju.



Before the networking part started, there were some presentations. Since we were a bit late, we only catched the rest of Hartmut’s presentation about WTF (World Tag Framework). Flash developers out there, please check out this stuff! BarCamp was presented by Nils - in general and especially the one in Munich and the one for women coming soon.



After this presentation Magdalena did a small introduction to Netvibes’ widgets. The last presentation held by our friend Raju from Optaros (formerly at OpenLaszlo) was about E-Commerce and WebTV. He gave us some insights about IPTV and how video and multimedia can improve and enhance e-commerce/online shopping.

When the final presentation was over, the networking part started. We had a nice talk with Igor and Thomas. Igor is the founder of flaMap, a visual social network, and Thomas is founder of the job portal Spirofrog.



All in all: great event! Many thanks to Martin, Raju and the other helpers for organizing this event.
