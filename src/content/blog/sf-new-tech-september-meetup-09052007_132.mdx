				<div class="entry-content">

					Last Wednesday evening we headed over to Fat City on <span class="street-address">314 11th St.</span><span class="locality"> in San Francisco to attend</span> the **SF New Tech September Meetup** <span class="locality">. A lot of people (more than 150) did the same. It was crowded, so many had to stand at the bar or behind the seats during the presentations that started after 1/2 hour of networking. </span>
					


					

					There were about five product presentations:
					<ul>
						<li><span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description"></span>WellnesslogA diary system for people with medical conditions that require keeping track of what happens, so this info can be shared with a doctor after a while. </li>
						<li><span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description"></span>Conduit<span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description">a platform for building online communities via toolbars</span></li>
						<li><span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description">SezWho</span><span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description">“SezWho aims to be a distributed rating and reputation system for all user generated content.”</span></li>
						<li><span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description">us4real.comreal estate website / google maps mashup</span></li>
						<li><span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description">CrazyMenu</span><span class="truncateMe maxChars300" title="Show full description">“Crazymenu makes eating lunches easy as pie through a set of applications and patent pending tools and technologies that connects restaurants to office workers, and enables them to make the most of the short lunch hours.”</span></li>
					</ul>
					

					Honestly, getting hit by product pitches for 2 hours and paying 10 bucks for that is not our favorite. Drinks (non alc.) were 2 bucks. The special part of the evening was <span class="truncateMe maxChars300"
																																																	 title="Show full description">“60-Second Soapbox”. Everybody who had something to announce (job offer, new product etc.) could grab the mic for 60 seconds and tell it to everybody...many people that are looking for developers there (as usual). </span>
					


					

					Networking after the talks was the best part (also as usual). We met some interesting people like Martin (CEO of Tangler), David (SupercoolSchool.com)
					and Alex (Altrupreneur Center).
