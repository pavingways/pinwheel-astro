Yesterday we went to the Bloggertreffen in Munich which was loosely related to the DLD. Thanks to the sponsors Hubert Burda Media (the organizer of the DLD event),  and Telegate (11880), every guest received an 18 EUR voucher. So, beer and food were free.



It was a nice event and a good opportunity to meet some people (not only) from the German blogosphere. We had some interesting talks with people from the CCC, Focus, Townkings, BlogWerk and Xing. Almost the whole CScout team was there too.



Many thanks to Klaus Eck for organizing this event!
