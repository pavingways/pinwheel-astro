						**Intel and Nokia release new Linux OS “MeeGo”** 

							Intel and Nokia have merged Moblin and Maemo into **MeeGo** , a Linux based software platform designed to run
							**on any device**  from cars and home phones to computers and mobile phones. So MeeGo is a primary competitor to Google’s Linux-based Android as well as to Apple’s iPhone software and Microsoft’s
							Windows Mobile.

							MeeGo will ensure that third-party developers will be available to reach the wide range of product types mentioned above. Developers can create applications for MeeGo using the Qt
								framework and can market their apps through Nokia’s Ovi Store and Intel AppUpSM Center.

							The first version of MeeGo will be available in the second half of 2010. Nokia also said that it will continue to sell and develop its Symbian smartphone operating system alongside MeeGo.
