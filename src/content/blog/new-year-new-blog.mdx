<p>
Happy 2014 and welcome to our new blog!
</p>


<p>
It has been very quiet around here for a while &ndash; **over two years**  have passed since our last blog entry.
Now we&rsquo;re redefining, tightening and updating PavingWays and we made some changes to our blog too.
</p>

<h2>New Blog</h2>


<p>
We transferred the old pavingways.com from a self-hosted and heavily modified WordPress installation to a Jekyll/Octopress blog on GitHub Pages.
The page is additionally delivered through CloudFlare as we had CF set up before and it had proven to be reliable and fast.
</p>


<p>
The whole migration process went relatively smoothly however I had to make some adjustments here and there.
</p>

<h3>Migrate old WordPress Posts to Markdown</h3>


<p>
Before we settled with Octopress I tried Ghost and Jekyll directly, so it was clear I would need to have our old posts as Markdown files or HTML if everything else would fail.
</p>


<p>
So I wrote a PHP script that exported all of our old WordPress posts to Markdown files using an old PHP class called Markdownify.
Trouble was that this class needed way too many adjustments and I never was satisfied with the results, so I discarded wanting to have ALL posts in Markdown and decided to go with the Jekyll importer which produces HTML files.
The process looked simple and roughly goes like this:
</p>

<ul>
<li>export a WXR file from your WordPress &ldquo;Tools&rdquo; section</li>
<li>follow a few simple steps on the Jekyll importer page</li>
<li>have your old blog posts in _posts (as .html files)</li>
</ul>



<p>
Guess what &hellip; this did not work and first I got this:
</p>

```
$ jekyll import wordpress --source pavingways.wordpress.2014-01-05.xml

Could not require 'htmlentities', so the :clean_entities option is now disabled.
error: LoadError: cannot load such file -- mysql2. Use --trace to view backtrace

```


<p>
This is caused by some missing gems and you should &ldquo;gem install&rdquo; `htmlentities`, `sequel`, `mysql` and `mysql2` just to be sure.
</p>


<p>
Some more playing around with this revealed that apparently the command line suggested on the Jekyll importer page is/was simply wrong see my bug report:
The importer consists of several sub-importers for various systems and for wordpress there are two &ndash; one for self-hosted blogs and one for blogs on wordpress.com.
</p>


<p>
I had no local DB of my old blog at hand &ndash; unfortunately the wordpress importer requires one in contrast to above command line example. That was initially not clear to me and I already had my WXR file &hellip;<br/>
And so I went with the `wordpressdotcom` importer, also because I found a blog post on the matter and tried another command line (also contained in the Jekyll importer docs) which works:
</p>

```
$ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import"; JekyllImport::Importers::WordpressDotCom.run({ "source" =&gt; "pavingways.wordpress.2014-01-05.xml" })'

```


<p>
Basically I could also have done this and had saved some time, oh well:
</p>

```
$ jekyll import wordpressdotcom --source pavingways.wordpress.2014-01-05.xml

```


<p>
Now I had all my files in <em>_posts</em> as I wanted. My remaining issues with the wordpressdotcom importer were as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>filenames did not match my old URL scheme `/{post_name}_{ID}.html` .</li>
<li>files do not contain a `date` field in their head section</li>
<li>files do not contain a `comments` field in their head section</li>
<li>HTML in WordPress is apparently outputted using PHP&rsquo;s nl2br() function, so the HTML files did not contain the necessary `&lt;br&gt;`s</li>
</ul>



<p>
In my first stab at Ruby source code ever since I read this Rails book in 2005 I changed the jekyll-import Gem (the file is called `wordpressdotcom.rb`) so it did all of the above and finally I was happy with my old post files.
</p>


<p>
Some changes to the default Octopress theme and (S)CSS I had a working site and especially all of our old blog posts on GitHub.
</p>

<h3>Hosted Comments and Migration</h3>


<p>
The same WXR file I used for importing our old post can be used to import all comments to Disqus. Details see this blog post again.
The import worked alright, however I did not see any comments in the Disqus box below our posts.
</p>


<p>
Apparently Disqus and CloudFlare don&rsquo;t just work together as planned and so I followed this post and It worked &ndash; unfortunately only partly&hellip;
</p>


<p>
As it turns out I had to do a <em>domain migration</em> in Disqus (Discussions &ndash;> Tools) in order to see all my old comments.
Strangely this required me to migrate from my (unchanged) domain `pavingways.com` to `pavingways.github.io` so they now appear in Disqus like this:
</p>

```
pavingways.github.io/new-year-new-blog.html

```


<p>
I had no time digging deeper but apparetly disqus realizes that my page is hosted on GitHub.
Finally all comments show up and we have a working blog again.
</p>


<p>
Octopressâ€™ rake commands make it now simple and easy to write/debug posts and deploy them to GitHub.
</p>


<p>
**Happy New Year!**
