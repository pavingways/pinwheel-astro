As of February 1st there have been massive price drops amongst some of Germanyâ€™s pay-as-you-go / prepaid offers such as blau.de, Symio and Aldi talk. Aldi talk even offers UMTS / 3G SIM cards, so users can profit from the new cheap rates while using fast connections. All these discount MVNOs are using the network and infrastructure of E-Plus. Apparently E-Plus has dramatically lowered the reseller tariffs for data traffic.





Other prepaid offers, such as callmobile.de or klarmobil.de which are based on the network of t-mobile did not lower their data prices, so  there is now quite a gap between the cheapest offers from above and others.



Users of the cheaper services now only pay **0,24 Cents per 1 MB** , whereas the more expensive providers charge **50 times as much** : 12 EUR per 1 MB!



We think this is great news for everybody who wants to use his cellphone for receiving e-mails and for browsing and using the mobile web. It also had the effect that I already canceled my data option with my current contract operator and will completely switch to pay-as-you-go myself after my contract runs out in a few months.
