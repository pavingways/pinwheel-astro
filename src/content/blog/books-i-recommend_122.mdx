The last couple of days we spent some time at Borders, a great bookstore. You have a really broad selection of books there and a cozy coffee shop inside, where you can read or do your work. I also love Amazon. So, the following list contains books from both retailers :)



My list of great books that in my opinion really help starting your (web) business:<ul>	<li>Guy Kawasaki: The Art of the Start</li>	<li>Guy Kawasaki: How to Drive Your Competition Crazy</li>	<li>Malcolm Gladwell: The Tipping Point</li>	<li>James Surowiecki: The Wisdom of Crowds</li>	<li>Mark Hughes: Buzzmarketing</li>	<li>Jessica Livingston: Founders at Work</li>	<li>John L. Nesheim: High Tech Start Up</li>	<li>Chris Anderson: The Long Tail</li>	<li>Keith Sawyer: Group Genius</li>	<li>Chris Murray: The Marketing Gurus</li></ul>

If you have read or know another must-read book, let me know!
