Some interesting stats about smart phone sales...

 

Worldwide sales of smart phones grew **30 percent**  in the fourth quarter of 2009 to **53 million phones** , according to researcher Strategy Analytics.

 

Nokia led market volumes, ahead of Research in Motion (RIM) and Apple, and shipped 20.8 million smart phones during the fourth quarter - up 38% from one year ago.
