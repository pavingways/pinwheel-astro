—————–



Just a quick reminder: we are holding our first PhoneGap &amp; HTML5 Meetup this Thursday in Frankfurt/Main.



Last year we already held a couple of HTML5 Meetups. This year we want to focus more on the mobile part: mobile development and PhoneGap. Nitobi, the guys from PhoneGap, will support our Meetup group and hopefully we get some cutting-edge insights from the PhoneGap project.



Anyone is invited to join our informal group. We are holding our next Meetup in a Ebbelwoi restaurant in a relaxed atmosphere. Demos or small presentations are welcome. The final location will be announced soon.



If you wanna join us on Thursday (May 26th), please sign up here:
