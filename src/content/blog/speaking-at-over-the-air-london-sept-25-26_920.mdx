We are really looking forward to our next trip to London. This week is ”London Digital Week” and we will be attending Over The Air  - 24 hour of mobile development, a mobile developer and design event. Too bad we knew about London Digital Week too late, so we will miss some other (mobile related) events, such as Nokia Ovi Developer Open Door.



I am really happy that I am one of the speakers at Over The Air 2009. The line-up of speakers is great and the topics are impressive. There will be panels, sessions, discussions, workshops etc. - all about mobile development and design topics and there will also be an all-night hack-a-thon.

My session “Mobile Widgets - Worth the hassle?” focuses on comparing the **different widget engines**  out there, on already existing and planned **application stores**  and the question: **is it worth to develop for one specific app store/engine or not** .  I will also present an open wiki project collecting information about app stores and widget engines and invite the community to participate. Watch this space for update about this!

<span class="status-body"><span class="entry-content">Due to overwhelming popular demand the organizers have released more tickets for Over the Air - register here. I think Over The Air will be THE mobile event this year packed with </span></span>a lot of bleeding edge knowledge to gain and interesting people in the mobile space to meet.



If you are not able to attend, you can stay updated by following my tweets - @GeeROC - and of course there will be a summary blog post right here too.
